# Project Planner App Backend

This app helps manage the backend of a react application for tracking activities and costs on a project. Each activity has many costs, and this uses Active Record and Sinatra to manage the relationship ties. 


## Getting Started

Clone the frontend for the React page: 
[sintra-react-project-frontend](https://github.com/bperez3237/phase-3-sinatra-react-project-frontend)

To start the server run: 
```bash
rake server
```

Data is provided in db/seeds.rb as an example.
